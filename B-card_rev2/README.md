# Thermal Logo Business Card
A business card that "prints" the company logo on thermal paper.


# Possible Issues with the Design
- Load resistors might need to be smaller to increase current draw.
- IDK if the bootloader I plan on using is compatible with the MCU I nabbed from digikey, I think it will but there is a chance it wont.
- The high current part of the PCB might get a wee bit warm.
- IDK about the switch I picked.
- Still no power switch
- No safety measures in place.
- Publishing my contact details online... not too bright... but oh well.
- My confidence level is 65% (kinda high, its usually only 40%)
- Oh WOW!, I should have inverted the QR code.....
